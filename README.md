**Data Visualisation** | **Visual Communication** | **Generative Art**

I'm Oli. I'm a data visualisation designer, programmer and musician. I also make generative art. This page is a repository for my data sketches, prototypes, analysis and general musings.

*Most of my work is coded in R or p5.js, though I also occasionally use Tableau, Flourish and Raw.*

*Illustrative design and data complexity*
Some graphics are designed to communicate an idea. They don't have data behind them. The 'flatten the curve' design we're now so familiar with is illustrative in nature. In terms of visual communication, it makes it's point clearly, more clearly in fact than if it used statistical models as the message isn't 'restricted' by real data or forecasts. The lines are neat, smooth, the message simple and effective. The Wall Street Journal interactive graphic which explained how an imaginary disease spreads was similar in it's effectiveness. It told the story beautifully clearly, precisely because it was illustrative not data-driven. 

On the other hand, data visualisations of complex subjects are often complex themselves. Multi faceted designs can require a degree of data literacy, graphical literacy and patience. For example we have now become accustomed to the log scales used in many representations of COVID-19 spread (including those by the excellent graphics team at the Financial Times) whether the measure involved is cases or deaths. Depending on the intended message, using a log scale makes sense when visualising exponential disease spread but in terms of visual communication, what is the trade-off between this visual complexity and what is lost in translation? 

There's no simple answer. Both 'simple' and 'complex' visualisations are needed. Complexity should not necessarily always be avoided in favour of simplicity. Some visualisations are ‘complex’ and all the better for it. Over-simplification can be misleading. Overlooking detail and ignoring error or uncertainty in favour of the ‘quick and easy’ message can give the wrong impression. 

The key for the designer is to have a firm understanding on their intended message: what they are trying to communicate. Plus a clear picture of their audience: who they are trying to communicate to.

A kind of treemap. The leaf nodes in this case are the towns (eg Padstow) and the 'weight' which sizes them is the number of beaches in that area.
