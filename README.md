**Data Visualisation** | **Visual Communication** | **Generative Art**

I'm Oli. I'm an R programmer, designer and musician. I design graphics and tools for understanding, exploration and storytelling.

**Generative Art**  
I've been creating generative art for about a year or so. As with my data viz work I primarily use R, but have recently started exploring p5.js. Some day I'll buy a pen plotter and bring the plots to life!
