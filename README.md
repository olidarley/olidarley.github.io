**Data Visualisation** | **Visual Communication** | **Generative Art**

I'm Oli. I'm a data visualisation designer, programmer and musician. I also make generative art.

This page is a repository for my data sketches, prototypes, analysis and general musings.

Most of my work is coded in R or p5.js, though I also occasionally use Tableau, Flourish and Raw.

**The north coast of Cornwall is famous for it's big, sandy beaches**  
A kind of treemap. The leaf nodes in this case are the towns (eg Padstow) and the 'weight' which sizes them is the number of beaches in that area.
