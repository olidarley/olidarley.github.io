**Data visualisation analysis** | **Visual communication** | **Generative art**

I have worked as a Data Visualisation Analyst for an arts exam board since 2015. I enjoy designing expository graphics and building exploratory tools. I primarily use R, but also enjoy using p5.js, Flourish, Tableau. I'm also a drummer and songwriter. Over the last year I've begun a new journey into generative art.

Here are some examples of my visual analysis work from the Tidy Tuesday R data project

Over the last year I've started getting into generative art. As with my data viz work I primarily use R, but have recently started exploring p5.js.
