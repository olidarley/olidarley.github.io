**Data Visualisation** | **Visual Communication** | **Generative Art**

I'm Oli. I'm a programmer, designer and musician. I design graphics and build tools for understanding, exploration and storytelling. I also make generative art.

This page is a repository for my data sketches, prototypes and visual analysis.

**The north coast of Cornwall is famous for it's big, sandy beaches**  
A kind of treemap. The leaf nodes in this case are the towns (eg Padstow) and the 'weight' which sizes them is the number of beaches in that area.
