**Data Visualisation** | **Visual Communication** | **Generative Art**

I'm Oli. I'm a data visualisation designer, programmer and musician. I also make generative art. This page is a repository for my data sketches, prototypes, analysis and general musings.

*Most of my work is coded in R or p5.js, though I also occasionally use Tableau, Flourish and Raw.*

*Illustrative design and data-driven complexity: Comparing two famous COVID-19 charts.*

In the world of data visualisation, an illustrative design might be classed as one driven not by the data but rather by the message. The 'flatten the curve' graphic we're by now so familiar with is an example; illustrative in nature, from the stark difference in the curves to the positioning of the horizontal line indicating hospital capacity. In terms of visual communication, it makes it's point clearly, more clearly it could be argued, than if it used statistical models as the message isn't 'restricted' by real data or forecasts. The lines are neat, smooth, the message simple and effective: 'Act, or else'.

Sometimes however, data visualisations of complex subjects cannot avoid being challenging themselves. 'Simplicity' should not be seen a goal when visualising data. Alberto Cairo has frequently written/spoken of the difference between 'simplicity' and 'clarity' as well as differentiating between 'complexity' vs 'complicatedness'

It is helpful, even in the world of business where patience can be short, to see visualising data in terms of clarity of design rather than simplicity.

The visual decoding of complex, multi-faceted (and often inconsistent and unreliable) data such as COVID-19 data, can require a degree of data literacy, graphical literacy and patience. There are occasions where it is appropriate to encourage and even demand this patience. The pay-offs can be worth it. For example the log scales used in many representations of trends in COVID-19 cases or deaths, especially those by the excellent graphics team at the Financial Times, have become normalised over the last couple of months.

Depending on the intended message, using a log scale makes sense when visualising exponential disease spread but the question for the designer must always be, in terms of visual communication, what is the trade-off between visual complexity and understanding? 

Often, the simplest designs can be the most powerful. On the other hand, complexity should not necessarily always be avoided in favour of simplicity. Many visualisations are ‘complex’ and all the better for it. Over-simplification is misleading. Overlooking detail and ignoring error or uncertainty in favour of the ‘quick and easy’ message can frequently give the wrong impression. 

The most satisfactory answer to the question: 'How do we look at this?' is usually 'From multiple perspectives'. Rather than relying on a single model and searching for an 'answer', use many models (from a variety of sources) and search for understanding. Visualisation can be thought of similarly as a contextual framework: gain understanding through multiple viewpoints and perspectives.

Both these visualisations have been at the heart of our understanding of this new reality. In both cases design is king.
